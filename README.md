# SoftTracer
A Software Raytracer written in C++.
I expect to be able to import a Raytracer "soon".

## Features
Currently
- It supports multi threaded jobs.
- It shows how to use SDL 2.0 with a software rendered image and how to avoid hogging the cpu after rendering finished.
- It has been tested with a raytracing algorithm but it was ugly and it was set to fire. A new algorithm will be imported "soon".

## Getting Started
The project has been currently tested only on Windows 10, but there should be no reason why it shouldn't run on linux and other popular systems such as Amigas or OpenBSDs.
To compile the project, you need a source distribution of SDL in C:\SDL\SDL2-devel-2.0.5-VC\SDL2-2.0.5.1 If running on windows you currently need to have SDL2.dll (the version of your build, 64 bits or 32 bits) in the visual studio directory.
